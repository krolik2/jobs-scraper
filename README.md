# jobs-scraper
My first attempt on Node.js. Scraper app which gets all frontend job offers from 3 popular job listing sites. 

It's possible to find any job offers on following websites:
- justjoin.it 
- pracuj.pl
- nofluffjobs.com

All you have to do is change query params URL variables.

1. To run this app you need Node.js.
2. Run npm install to get https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer library.
3. To start the app type in terminal: "node app.js"

Watch magic happen :)
